K2 editor is the plugin for Joomla but it was supported till Joomla version 3
As You know now we have newer version of Joomla so ... Need to disable the plugin to succesfully upgrade Your Joomla CMS.
Unfortunately disabling K2 plugin is equally to drop all the articles which we made before.
So ... i created some scripts which are importing articles from K2 plugin straight to the Joomla articles manager.
